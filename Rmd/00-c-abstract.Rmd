# Abstract {-}

Temporal-context data sets often include a richness of information that is not possible to include in the typical data formats that are used in time series analysis. They also present some complications for modelling and visualisation, such as a long time spans, multiple factor variables, heterogeneous data types, low time resolutions, implicit missing values, and multilevel temporal components. In this thesis, we extend the conceptual tidy data framework, which provides the foundation for good modern data practice, to encompass time series data, and develop new graphics for displaying temporal data. First, we develop a new calendar view for visualising sub-daily time series data, which is particularly useful for viewing people patterns. Second, we have extended the tidy data concept to temporal data, and note that the "molten" data structure is flexible enough to handle the full richness of these complex data sets, heterogeneous variables, missing values. The tidy temporal data also builds on ideas of a data pipeline which improves and supports an organised workflow for data analysis. The third topic will focus on providing a visualisation framework for time series with nested and crossed factors. All the methods have been implemented in the `R` packages **sugrrants** for visualisation and **tsibble** for tidy time series data.
