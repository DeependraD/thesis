# Introduction {#ch:intro}

This thesis contributes to three different facets of working with temporal data, and is grounded in the exploratory data analysis pipeline for time series. It begins the pipeline by visualising data in the time context: Section \@ref(sec:calendar-vis) introduces the calendar-based graphics for plotting people's daily activities in a calendar layout, detailed in Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis). This in turn motivates a new data abstraction in need of streamlining transformation, visualisation, and modelling for analysing time series: Section \@ref(sec:tsibble) introduces the "tsibble" data structure to form the foundation of time series pipelines, expanded in Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble). The tsibble representation breeds the ground for framing missing value of time series in the data-centric workflow: Section \@ref(sec:mists) introduces explanatory tools for understanding missing patterns in time, described in Chapter \@ref(ch:mists). Finally, Chapter \@ref(ch:conclusion) summarises the software tools developed for the work and the impact, and discusses the future plans.

It has been a long-held belief that exploratory data analysis is a highly ad hoc statistical area, impossible to teach or formalise. This has radically changed in recent years: by working with the "tidy data" [@wickham2014tidy] as a fundamental unit, data plots and data wrangling can be formally described using a generalised set of abstract grammar, for example the grammar of graphics and data manipulation, as implemented in the **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] and **dplyr** [@R-dplyr] R packages. These are the core of the **tidyverse** concepts and suite of tools. My work leverages the **tidyverse** way of thinking to the temporal domain, by providing tidy tools for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data series.

## Calendar-based graphics {#sec:calendar-vis}

Visualisation is critical in understanding the prominent data patterns as well as revealing the unexpected for exploratory data analysis. Calendar heatmaps are one of the widely used techniques for plotting people's activities on a daily basis. The comprehensive literature review on calendar-based graphics is given in Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis). However, calendar plots are limited in ways that graphical encoding is colour only and data input is a single value for each day. I develop a new method to ensemble small multiples into a calendar layout. It can be fully integrated into the grammar of graphics [@wilkinson2006grammar; @wickham2009ggplot2], which defines plots as a functional mapping from data variables to graphical primitives. This new calendar-based display facilitates to unfold more vivid and detailed data stories regarding daily and sub-daily human behaviours.

## Tidy temporal data structure {#sec:tsibble}

Data representation has been more often discussed in data science. "Tidy data" [@wickham2014tidy] is the fundamental data architecture of the **tidyverse** ecosystem, making it possible to build fluent data pipelines for transformation, visualisation, and modelling. But the current time series structure that was useful decades ago for modelling now starts creating barriers for a data-centric workflow. More discussions on data structures can be found in Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble). I propose a new tidy data abstraction for temporal data, which lubricates the plumbing of temporal data analysis to a great extent.
