# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Temporal data analysis has assumed that the entry point to data analysis is at a model-ready data format, which provides little organisation or conceptual oversight on how one should get the wild data into a tamed state. This mind-set is related to a long-held belief that exploratory data analysis is a highly ad hoc statistical area, impossible to teach or formalise. However, the **tidyverse** framework implemented in the statistical software R [@R-base], as originating in @wickham2014tidy fundamentally overturns this thinking. Data plots and data wrangling, for which the "tidy data" conceptualisation supports, can be formally described using an abstract grammar. The grammar of graphics and data manipulation, as implemented in the **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] and **dplyr** [@R-dplyr] R packages respectively, form the core of the **tidyverse** suite of tools. My contributions extend the **tidyverse** way of thinking to the temporal domain, by providing tidy tools, built as R packages, for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data analysis.

## Calendar-based graphics {#sec:calendar-vis}

Visualisation is critical for understanding data patterns, and for discovering the unexpected in data. Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis) describes how to make a calendar layout to produce a new type of plot. It is especially focused on human activity data can be examined to explore the rhythm of a society's daily behaviour, especially the distinctions between working and leisure life. The layout algorithm provides a new method for assembling small multiples into a familiar calendar structure. It is fully integrated into the grammar of graphics [@wilkinson2006grammar; @wickham2009ggplot2], specifying the plots as a functional mapping from data variables to graphical primitives. This new calendar-based display sketches the patterns of daily and sub-daily human behaviours, unlocking vivid and detailed data stories about the way we live. The chapter contains a comprehensive literature review related to calendar-based graphics. 

## Tidy temporal data structure {#sec:tsibble}

Data representation is an important component of data science research. "Tidy data" [@wickham2014tidy] is the fundamental data architecture of the **tidyverse** ecosystem, making it possible to build fluent data pipelines for transformation, visualisation, and modelling. It does not adequately describe temporal data, and the current time series structures that are primarily model-oriented, inhibits a data-centric workflow. This research develops a new tidy data abstraction for temporal data, which lubricates the plumbing of temporal data analysis. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble) describes this abstraction, the process of using it for time series analysis, and modeling, and includes a comprehensive literature review of related work. 

## Missingness in time {#sec:mists}

Missing data always creates an obstacle in data analysis, because many techniques cannot operate without complete data. Another way to think about it, is that the invisibles (missing values) may mask some data gems. The ability to explore missing value patterns without thought to later analyses, is a worthwhile pursuit in itself. To support missing value handling for temporal data, a new data structure is designed, which indexes missing values, and efficiently stores the information. Building on this, several new operations and visualisation methods have been designed. Chapter \@ref(ch:mists) describes these developments, and how they can be used to support exploration of missing patterns in time, and preparing data for imputation to feed into models. These methods expand the temporal data handling capabilities into a tidy workflow infrastructure.

## Summary

The thesis is structured as follows. Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis) provides details of the calendar plot, algorithm and applications. This is implemented in the R package **sugrrants**. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble) explains the new data abstraction--tsibble--and illustrates how it can be used to for the basis of exploratory methods, visualisation and modelling of temporal data. This is available as an R package **tsibble**. Chapter \@ref(ch:mists) describes new procedures for exploring for temporal missing patterns, and assisting in handling missing values prior to modeling. This is in the developing R package **mists**.

Chapter \@ref(ch:conclusion) summarises the software tools developed for the work and the impact, and discusses the future plans.
