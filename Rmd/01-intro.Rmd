# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Temporal data analysis has assumed that the entry point to data analysis is at model-ready data format, which provides little organisation or conceptual oversight on how one should get the wild data into a tamed state. This mind-set is related to a long-held belief that exploratory data analysis is a highly ad hoc statistical area, impossible to teach or formalise. However, the **tidyverse** framework, as originating in @wickham2014tidy fundamentally overturns this thinking. Data plots and data wrangling, for which the "tidy data" conceptualisation supports, can be formally described using an abstract grammar. The grammar of graphics and data manipulation, as implemented in the **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] and **dplyr** [@R-dplyr] R packages respectively, form the core of the **tidyverse** suite of tools. My contributions extend the **tidyverse** way of thinking to the temporal domain, by providing tidy tools for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data analysis.

## Calendar-based graphics {#sec:calendar-vis}

Visualisation is critical for understanding the data patterns, and for discovering the unexpected in data. Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis) describes how to make a calendar layout for plots, so that human activity data can be examined in a familiar form. I develop a new method for assembling small multiples into a calendar layout. It is fully integrated into the grammar of graphics [@wilkinson2006grammar; @wickham2009ggplot2], specifying the plots as a functional mapping from data variables to graphical primitives. This new calendar-based display sketches the patterns of daily and sub-daily human behaviours, unlocking vivid and detailed data stories about the way we live. The chapter contains a comprehensive literature review related to calendar-based graphics. 

## Tidy temporal data structure {#sec:tsibble}

Data representation is an important component of data science research. "Tidy data" [@wickham2014tidy] is the fundamental data architecture of the **tidyverse** ecosystem, making it possible to build fluent data pipelines for transformation, visualisation, and modelling. It does not adequately describe temporal data, and the current time series structures that are useful for modelling, inhibits a data-centric workflow. This research develops a new tidy data abstraction for temporal data, which lubricates the plumbing of temporal data analysis. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble) describes this abstraction, the process of using it for time series analysis, and a comprehensive literature review of related work. 

## Missingness in time {#sec:mists}

Chapter \@ref(ch:mists) develops exploratory and explanatory tools for understanding missing patterns in time, that fits into a tidy data workflow. This is a work in progress.

## Summary

Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis) provides full details of the calendar plot, algorithm and application. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble) explains the new data abstraction--tsibble--and illustrates how it can be used to for the basis of exploratory methods, visualisation and modelling of temporal data. Chapter \@ref(ch:mists) outlines a new nomenclature for temporal missing patterns, tools to identify these processes in data, and evaluate imputation results. 

Chapter \@ref(ch:conclusion) summarises the software tools developed for the work and the impact, and discusses the future plans.
