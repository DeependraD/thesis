# Conclusion and future plans {#ch:conclusion}

The three papers assembled in this thesis, share a common theme of exploratory analysis for temporal data using tidy tools. Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis), "Calendar-based graphics for visualizing people's daily schedules", described a new calendar-based display. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble), "A new tidy data structure to support exploration and modeling of temporal data", proposed a new temporal data abstraction. Chapter \@ref(ch:mists), "", demystified missing data in time. These papers are bundled with software. In this conclusion, I will give a brief summary of each package, and discuss the future directions of my research.

## Software development

```{r software-impact}
library(cranlogs)
sugrrants_dl <- cran_downloads("sugrrants", from = "2017-07-28")
tsibble_dl <- cran_downloads("tsibble", from = "2018-01-09")
```

A particular emphasis of this thesis is translating research methodologies in the form of open source R packages: **sugrrants**, **tsibble**, and **mists**.

### sugrrants

The **sugrrants** package implements the idea of displaying data in the familiar calendar style in the `frame_calendar()` and `facet_calendar()`. The research article, a shorter version of Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis), has been awarded the best student paper prize from ASA Sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics and ACEMS Business Analytics in 2018. There have been a grand total of `r format(sum(sugrrants_dl$count), big.mark = ",")` downloads from the RStudio mirror (one of 90 CRAN mirrors) dating from 2017-07-28 to `r Sys.Date()`; and it has been starred 47 times on Github so far. The homepage at <https://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants> contains detailed documentation and a vignette on `frame_calendar()`.

### tsibble

The **tsibble** package provides a data infrastructure and a domain specific language in R for representing and manipulating tidy temporal data. This package is aimed for the fundamental architecture that other temporal tools will be built upon. For example, a new suite of time series analysis packages, titled ["tidyverts"](https://github.com/tidyverts), have been developed for the new "tsibble" object. The **tsibble** package has won 2019 John Chambers Statistical Software Award from ASA Sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics. It has been downloaded `r format(sum(tsibble_dl$count), big.mark = ",")` times from the RStudio mirror since it landed on CRAN on 2018-01-09; and it has received 234 stars on Github. These metrics are the indicators of my research impact, the recognition by professionals, and the uptakes by users. The website (<https://tsibble.tidyverts.org>) includes full documentation and three vignettes about the package usage.

### mists

The **mists** package aims at exploring missing values for temporal data both analytically and graphically. It implements a compact abstraction for efficiently indexing missing data in time, along with numerical and visual methods. It also brings missing data polishing techniques into live. The Github repository has received 22 stars, but the package is not on CRAN yet. The documentation site is available at <https://pkg.earo.me/mists>. 

## Future work

## Process for generating missing data in time

### Visual methods for temporal data of nesting and crossing factors
